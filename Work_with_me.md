Work with me.
=============

Best way to communicate: asyncronous text. If you really want to **speak** with me please ~think twice~ tell me way before. I am frequently work in coffee shops or another places with huge amount of background noise.

I am asking a lot of questions, which can sound really stupid and annoying. But if I asking something, this means I need this information, not because I want to chick chat (I don't)

"UDP-person", so you will rare hear from me things like "Hello", "How are you?" and when you hear them, they will sound really unnatural.

Backend engineer up to my bones, so questions and opinions about UX or anything related to humans is way behind my head. Black and white is best design, formatted JSON - best human readable format. 

Completly open to discuss anything about my work, completly closed to discuss anything about myself outside work.

Self-learner, so if you will ask me questions about things "all educated people should know" in most cases I will look at you with blank stare. This things includes concepts from Computer Science too... 

Have a very irregular schedule and chaotic life, so its better to let me know about meetings or anything similar at least two days before this should happen. And send invite, because I am frequently mess up with timezones.

If you want to say something to me - do it directly without plesantries. Believe me, I'll survive :)
